The provided text explains that theory is fundamentally a linguistic construct, a system of words built to comprehend reality. It involves giving names to "things", which are diverse phenomena like actions, discourse, representation, affect, or the spatiotemporal arrangement of objects and bodies.

These names allow us to organize reality to understand it. Common ideas about theory suggest that a fact or thing becomes comprehensible because it takes on a form (like a model, scheme, or structure), is rigorously formulated (as a proposition, definition, or axiom), or has its properties, governing rules, or systemic inscriptions revealed within a historical context.

This definition comes from an article by Á. Carvajal titled "Teorías y modelos: formas de representación de la realidad," published in Comunicación, Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica 12/1 (2002): 1-14.
